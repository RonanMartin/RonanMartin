- ðŸ”­ Hi, I'm an entrepreneur who recently fell in love with programming. Currently, I work with the clothing trade in Brazil.  https://www.martinshop.com.br/
- ðŸŒ± I am currently interested in the GO language. I have studied through tutorials and Youtube courses. Studies on API development, and some other applications, including CRUD with MySQL database. Although I'm focusing my studies on the Back-End, I've also studied some HTML and CSS to learn how the Front-End communicates with the Back-End.
  In the next studies I intend to delve deeper into GIT and LINUX, in order to master the workflow in GIT, and understand the Operating System through the CLI. 
After that, I intend to develop an application that facilitates the conference and launch of purchases in my company.
- ðŸ’¬ I am developing my communication in English with studies through mobile apps, and I hope to be able to speak better in a few months, considering that I have studied daily.
- ðŸ‘¯ I would like to collaborate with a company that gives me the opportunity to work as a volunteer in the backend, through the home office.
