Hello, I'm an entrepreneur who recently fell in love with programming. Currently, I work with the clothing trade in Brazil.

I just finished the Bootcamp Journey DevOps with AWS - Impulso, with excellent courses on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes and AWS. Great topics that I intend to delve into.

I have knowledge in the GO language, where I studied a lot through tutorials and courses on Youtube. Development studies of APIs, and some other applications, including CRUD with MySQL database. Despite focusing my studies on the Back-End, I also studied some HTML and CSS to learn how the Front-End communicates with the Back-End.
As a personal project I intend to develop an application that facilitates the conference and launch of purchases in my company.

I'm developing my communication in English with studies through mobile applications, and I hope to be able to speak better in a few months, considering that I've been studying daily.

I would like to collaborate with a company that gives me the opportunity to work as a volunteer in the backend, through the home office.
